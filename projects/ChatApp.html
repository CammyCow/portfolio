	<h4>Connecting</h4>
	<p>
		
		Java application that allows users to remotely create chatrooms and message other users. 
		Upon launch, establishes a connection to a PubSub server, labelled as "Discovery Server" in this project, which allows an individual's ip to be easily discoverable by other users. Upon selecting an user,
		a direct connection is established and connection stubs are exchanged to allow messaging.
		An "auto-connect-back" feature allows a newly connected user to receive all the connection stubs of a user with pre-existing user connections.
		
	</p>
	<h4>Custom Messaging</h4>
	<p>The ChatApp API also allows the creation of custom messages that can take advantage of Java Swing elements, such as button creation. See demo video above. </p>
